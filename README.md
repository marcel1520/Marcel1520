Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Marcel and this is my GitHub Profile.

After the completion of a Software Engineering Course at Masterschool I am now specializing in Machine Learning and AI Tasks.
I am especially interested in the mechanics behind the functionality of LLMs and am currently completing a set of lectures that give comprehensive insight in the architecture of Neural Networks.
